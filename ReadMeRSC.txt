This app shows how to run client-side html/js/css directly from files (i.e. no server).
For example, the browser URL for this project is: file:///D:/Personal/Web/NodeProjects/ClientFileBasedAppGS/index.html

This does not use Node. Mainly for simple client-side testing.

I have also used it for my first git/github experiment.
